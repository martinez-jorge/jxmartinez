I am an Institutional Research Analyst at Rice University. I analyze and report on institutional data to support decision-making at Rice. Although I am trained as a sociologist with a focus in deviance and social control, I leverage my skills in research design, statistics, and data visualization to tackle questions in higher education. When I am not playing with data or learning a new R package, you can find me cycling around Houston, visiting museums, or spending time with my pug.
