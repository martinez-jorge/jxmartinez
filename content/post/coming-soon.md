In this section, I will share my experiences as a researcher in higher education. I left graduate school in 2014 to pursue a career in research and data analytics just short of finishing my dissertation. I have grown and learned much more in the past five years than I did in graduate school. That is not to say my training at the University of Washington was not beneficial. In fact, it was probably some of the best training I could get as a budding sociologist. However, leaving academia gave me an opportunity to grow my data proficiency to a much broader, more applied, and richer skill set beyond theory testing in a narrowly-defined academic setting.

Here are some of the topics I hope to cover in the near future:

* Why I decided to leave my doctoral program for applied research in higher education.
* How to communicate research to non-data people.
* Navigating the world of university rankings.
* How to introduce new ideas to traditional and conservative organizations.
* Exploring the importance of graphic design in data visualization.
* How to use R for analysis, visualization, report writing, and more.

Ultimately, I hope this site becomes a place for others to learn new skills and apply them in their own work just like I have. You don't need a Ph.D. to do quality research (although it sure does help)!
