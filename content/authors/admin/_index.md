I am the Director of Data Strategy at [BakerRipley](https://bakerripley.org). I lead a team of researchers and data scientists in the Community Impact and Vitality department. We provide data analyses to support BakerRipley's strategic goals in service to our Neighbors in the Houston region. Although I am trained as a sociologist with a focus in deviance and social control, I leverage my skills in research design, statistics, and data visualization to tackle questions in the non-profit sector. When I am not playing with data or learning a new R package, you can find me cycling around Houston, visiting museums, or spending time with my pug.
