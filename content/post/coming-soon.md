In this section, I will share my experiences as a researcher in higher education. I left graduate school in 2014 to pursue a career in research and data analytics just short of finishing my dissertation. I have grown and learned so much since then. Leaving academia gave me an opportunity to grow my data proficiency to a much broader, more applied, and richer skill set beyond testing theory in a narrowly-focused academic setting.

Here are some of the topics I hope to cover in the near future:

* Why I decided to leave my doctoral program for applied research in higher education.
* How to communicate research to non-data people.
* Navigating the world of university rankings.
* How to introduce new ideas to traditional and conservative organizations.
* Exploring the importance of graphic design in data visualization.
* How to use R for analysis, visualization, report writing, and more.

Ultimately, I built this site as an online portfolio to share my work. I have encountered many helpful posts by others in the R community and I hope my content sparks ideas as others have inspired me.
