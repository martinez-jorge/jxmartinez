# Abstract

Each year the U.S. News & World Report publish their Best College Rankings. This year the University of Houston moved up 9 spots to No. 176 of the top 389 [Best National Universities](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities) for Issue Year 2021.

In this report (link above), I discuss our National University Ranking for Issue Year 2021. I summarize our key rankings and recognitions under various categories and lists. I review changes in ranking factors, provide trends in ranking metrics, and analyze how the University of Houston performs relative to our [comparable and aspirational peers](https://jxmartinez.com/talk/identifying-institutional-peers/).
