summary: How to construct open-source data visualization with Google Charts using the *googleVis* package in R.
abstract: Interested in creating online dashboards without paying big software prices? Google Charts API provides an open-source platform for constructing interactive graphics for IR websites at no cost. In this session, I will demonstrate how to construct bar, line, and pie charts, hierarchical tree maps and state maps using JavaScript, HTML, and R languages. At the end of this demonstration, participants will have an introductory understanding of the data structure, anatomy, and implementation of Google Charts on an IR web page for internal and external constituent consumption. Also presented at [TAIR Summer 2017 and 2018 Pre-Conference workshops](http://texas-air.org/index.php/professional-development/upcoming-and-past-workshops/).
