I am the Director of Research & Reporting for Enrollment Services at the University of Houston. I analyze admissions, financial aid, and enrollment data to support decision-making at UH. Although I am trained as a sociologist with a focus in deviance and social control, I leverage my skills in research design, statistics, and data visualization to tackle questions in higher education. When I am not playing with data or learning a new R package, you can find me cycling around Houston, visiting museums, or spending time with my pug.
