I am the Director of Data Science at the Houston Independent School District. I lead a team of data scientists in the Division of Assessment, Accountability, and Compliance. We provide data analyses to support the District's strategic goals in service of the children of the City of Houston. Although I am trained as a sociologist with a focus in deviance and social control, I leverage my skills in research design, statistics, and data visualization to tackle questions in education. When I am not playing with data or learning a new R package, you can find me cycling around Houston, visiting museums, or spending time with my pug.
