      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will share my experiences as a researcher in higher education. I left graduate school in 2014 to pursue a career in research and data analytics just short of finishing my dissertation. I have grown and learned much more in the past five years than I did in graduate school. That is not to say my training at the University of Washington was not beneficial. In fact, it was probably some of the best training I could get as a budding sociologist. However, leaving academia gave me an opportunity to grow my data proficiency to a much broader, more applied, and richer skill set beyond theory testing in a narrowly-defined academic setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the topics I hope to cover in the near future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why I decided to leave my doctoral program for applied research in higher education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to communicate research to non-data people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigating the world of university rankings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to introduce new ideas to traditional and conservative organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring the importance of graphic design in data visualization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use R for analysis, visualization, report writing, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I hope this site becomes a place for others to learn new skills and apply them in their own work just like I have. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a Ph.D. to do quality research (although it sure does help)!&lt;/p&gt;
