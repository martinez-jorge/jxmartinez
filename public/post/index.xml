      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will share my experiences as a researcher in higher education. I left graduate school in 2014 to pursue a career in research and data analytics just short of finishing my dissertation. I have grown and learned so much since then. Leaving academia gave me an opportunity to grow my data proficiency to a much broader, more applied, and richer skill set beyond testing theory in a narrowly-focused academic setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the topics I hope to cover in the near future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why I decided to leave my doctoral program for applied research in higher education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to communicate research to non-data people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigating the world of university rankings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to introduce new ideas to traditional and conservative organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring the importance of graphic design in data visualization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use R for analysis, visualization, report writing, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I built this site as an online portfolio to share my work. I have encountered many helpful posts by others in the R community and I hope my content sparks ideas as others have inspired me.&lt;/p&gt;
