# Abstract

The [Higher Education Research and Development Survey (HERD)](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyherd/) is the primary source of information on Research and Development (R&D) expenditures at U.S. colleges and universities. The survey collects information on R&D expenditures by field of research and source of funds and also gathers information on types of research and expenses. The survey is an annual census of institutions that expended at least $150,000 in separately accounted for R&D in the fiscal year.

This report (link above) explores UHâ€™s R&D data from FY 2010 to FY 2019. It includes summary trends and rankings for UH by different cross-sections and comparison groups. It also provides expenditure data for the following:

- All federal and non-federal R&D Expenditures
- Federal expenditures by agency
- Federal expenditures by field
- Non-federal expenditures by source
