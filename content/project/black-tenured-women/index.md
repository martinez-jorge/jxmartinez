# Abstract

The Chronicle of Higher Education [published an article](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-many-black-women-have-tenure-on-your-campus-search-here) investigating the number of tenured professors that are black women among public and private institutions in the U.S. Using data from *Fall 2019 IPEDS*, they find there were 25,921 tenured associate and full professors. Of those, 2.1 percent were black women.

In this brief (link above), I describe the variation of tenured black women among [member institutions](https://www.aau.edu/who-we-are/our-members) in the Association of American Universities (AAU). I rank each institution on percent of tenured professors that are black women with a focus on Rice University.

Data come from the U.S. Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The data include all degree-granting four-year public and private nonprofit institutions in the 50 states and Washington, D.C. that are eligible for federal aid. Tenured professors include tenured full professors and tenured associate professors.
